## Guides

### Adding a User
To add a user, a user must sign themselves up from the initial login screen.  An admin can later log in to grant that user admin privileges afterward, if desired.

## Views
The app has two different views.  One for "core" volunteers which I consider admins, and another for "customer" volunteers which I consider users.  Because of the Netzke/ExtJS framework I used, the current UI is non-intuitive and I feel like is only adequate for admins who can take the time to learn the system.  I'm in the process of designing a simpler mobile friendly UI with the essential functionality that's intended for users.

## Deployment
Currently, at the Velocipede collective we have it running on a computer in the shop on the local network.  The reason for this, is so that it's only accessible from within the shop.  I'm weighing out different methods for ensuring that users can only log in from within the shop (and not from home), such as a shop password that only admins can see and would make visible from within the physical bike shop.  I also don't have to worry about security issues while the app is in development.  In the future, I'd like to see the app hosted much like <http://freehub.bikekitchen.org/>.

## Ideas
At Velocipede, with a mobile friendly UI for users, I'm hoping we can get donations of old, unused smart phones, connected via local wifi, that can be used as stations to log a volunteer's work and hours.  They can be secured by gluing cables into the earphone jacks to deter theft if necessary.  This might be another way that the collective can promote reuse of materials.
